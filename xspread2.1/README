*INSTALL*
---------  

    should be pretty simple.  Use the Imakefile

    xmkmf
    make
    make install
    make install.man

    When it is compiling you should see a whole bunch of things defined
    on the command line.  If you don't edit the Imakefile and uncomment
    the STD_DEFINES line.  A correct line should look something like.

    cc -O    -I/usr/local/include   -DDOBACKUPS -DSIGVOID -DRINT -DRE_COMP 
    -DDFLT_PAGER=\"more\" -DSAVENAME=\"SC.SAVE\"  -DDOINGX -DSC_FONT=\"9x15\"
    -DCRYPT_PATH  -DBSD43 -DFUNCPROTO  -c cmds.c

       (--NOT--)

    cc -O -I/usr/include/mit -c cmds.c

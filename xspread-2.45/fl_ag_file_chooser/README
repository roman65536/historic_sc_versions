Here's a modified fl_file_chooser which fits nicely on the
agenda's screen with keyboard and status bar. It also uses a
modified Fl_Browser_ (called Fl_Ag_Browser_). One feature is
a nice 10 pixel wide scroll bar on the file browser (which is
more reasonable than 16 for agenda's tiny screen). To use,
you'll need to change all your references of fl_file_chooser
(or my_fl_file_chooser) to fl_ag_file_chooser. You must use
the two together (Fl_Ag_Browser_/fl_ag_file_chooser) or
further modify them. Header files included.

any one of the thousand source packages you probably have on

The make process is geared towards compilation on an ix86 linux host.
There are three main targets:

* The default for a simple "make" is to build a version of xspread for
  ix86 (i.e. for a desktop or laptop).  "make install" puts this in
  place (by default under /usr/local), and "make install.man" installs
  the manual page.  This default make also builds the auxiliary
  program "psc", a filter for processing a plain text,
  space-separated, data file into xspread spreadsheet format.  This
  program also has a manual page.

* "make test" builds a version of xspread for ix86 that acts the same
  way as the build for the agenda (tiny window size, modified
  processing of mouse-related X events and so on).  This is convenient
  for testing the agenda version without having to rsync it to the
  agenda over and over.  The binary is in the ./test directory.

* "make vr3" builds an xspread binary for the agenda vr3.  To make
  this target you need to have the mipsel-linux-gcc cross-compiler
  installed, plus the appropriate libraries and headers.  The binary
  should be found in the ./vr3 subdirectory.

It's possible that the top-level Makefile, and/or the Makefiles in
./test and ./vr3, might need a little editing for your system.

If you want to enable xspread's "vi mode" for editing expressions
to be entered into spreadsheet cells, edit near the top of
config.h in this top-level directory, or put "-DUSE_VI_MODE"
into the CFLAGS in the relevant Makefile.
